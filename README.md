Our stakeholders include both the EPA and minorities and women who own small businesses.

Our goal is to help the EPA identify how they can help more economically disadvantaged and minority women business owners get approved for their contract awards. This helps the EPA accomplish its goal of helping grow small businesses and help small businesses get the necessary funding they need to grow.

We are identifying key factors that either helped or detracted from an application being approved. We plan to arm the business owners with the knowledge of what applications get approved so that they can consider these factors in their own applications. This data will also show the EPA how they may be biased in approving contract awards for specific owners of businesses.
